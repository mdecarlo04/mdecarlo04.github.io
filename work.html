					<p>I have been apart of UMass' literary journal, Jabberwocky, for 2 years. For the first year, I was an Editor for the Criticism/Nonfiction team, but was promoted to Assisstant Head Editor of the team in my second year. My job, both years, is to read and analyze the approximately 50 pieces we receive over the course of a couple of weeks. My team and I talk through our thoughts on each piece and rate them. After submissions are closed and every piece has been read, we choose the top 5 pieces to be published in the magazine. As Assisstant Head, I am the liaason between the rest of my team and our admin team and I take notes on everybody's thoughts and organize them into a spreadsheet.</p>

					<h2>The Roman</h2>
					<p>Over the summer, I spent 6 weeks in Oxford studying under incredible Oxford professors, one of them being Sally Bayley. Her class, British Detective Fiction, started off with reading <i>Bleak House</i> by Charles Dickens. We analyzed the novel and spoke in great detail about the mystery aspects. I had to write an analysis piece on anything about the book that I would like to and I wrote about the Roman on the ceiling of Mr. Tulkinghorn's office. Dr. Bayley gave incredible feedback and the result is a piece I am incredibly proud of and speaks to my time in Oxford and all that I learned while I was there.</p>

					<h2>This Portfolio!</h2>
					<p>This entire website was coded by me! As a <a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/professional-writing-and-technical-communication">Professional Writing and Technical Communication</a> student, I have spent the past semester learning HTML and CSS. This portfolio is the cumulation of an entire semester learning a completely new skill and my application of it into a portfolio showing off my work.</p>
