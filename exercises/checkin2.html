		<h2>My Favorite Part of Oxford</h2>
		<p>After spending 6 weeks in Oxford, I found that my favorite part of the city was not the bustling downtown, but was Jericho, a suburb of Oxford. I stayed at Keble College during my stay and Jericho was a short walk away. There are tons of cute cafes, the Oxford Canal, and cute shops all around. My favorite part of Jericho was Port Meadow, which I mentioned earlier. Horses and cows roam freely, but my favorite thing to do was to sit by the Thames River running through the meadow and read. Nothing more peaceful in the world.</p>
