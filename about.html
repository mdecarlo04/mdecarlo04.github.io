				<h2>About Mary!</h2>
				<p>Hi there! My name is Mary DeCarlo and welcome to my portfolio! I am a junior <a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/">English major</a> at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> with a minor in <a href="https://www.isenberg.umass.edu/programs/undergraduate/on-campus/academics/business-minor">business</a> and a specialization in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/professional-writing-and-technical-communication">Professional Writing and Technical Communications</a>. I am looking to pursue a career in publishing as I am an avid reader and have a deep passion for literature.<p>
				<p>At UMass, I have been working at the <a href="https://fac.umass.edu/Online/default.asp">Fine Arts Center</a> Box Office since my freshman year. I am a Student Manager and here is where I have been cultivating my leadership skills and enhancing my customer service skills. While it is not exactly correlated to what I want to persue, it has taught me necessary organizational, collaborative, and leadership skills.</p>
				<p>While I am not working at the Box Office, I am apart of the English department's literary journal, <a href="https://websites.umass.edu/jabberwocky/?_gl=1%2Aak7b89%2A_gcl_au%2AMzkxODA3MjYzLjE3NDQ0Nzg0NjE.%2A_ga%2AMjA3NDIzNzE0Mi4xNjUzODc0ODM0%2A_ga_21RLS0L7EB%2AczE3NDY1NDcxNDYkbzEzNSRnMCR0MTc0NjU0NzE0NiRqMCRsMCRoMA..">Jabberwocky</a>, as the Assistant Head Editor of the Criticism/Nonfiction section. My section is in charge of reading all of the Criticism/Nonfiction submissions and making the decision of who to put in the journal. Every semester, my team receives about 40 submissions, ranging from creative nonfiction to analyzing movies and literature, where we are in charge of choosing which pieces will be published. I am also lucky enough to be a staff member of the <a href="https://dailycollegian.com/">Daily Collegian</a> on the arts team where I get to write about any music, movie, or pop culture that I am interested in. Samples of my work can be found on my work samples page.</p>
				<p>While I'm not working or going to class, you can usually find me sitting outside with my nose in a book or watching the newest movie release at AMC. Thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio and learning more about me!</p>
